 Fake Bank Project

Overview
This project involved completing a TryHackMe simulation where I simulated a cyber attack on a fake bank.

Objectives
- Gain access to a fake bank account.
- Transfer funds between accounts.
- Learn about banking system vulnerabilities.

 Steps Taken
1.Reconnaissance: Gathered information about the application.
2. Exploitation: Found and exploited vulnerabilities for access.
3. Outcome: Successfully transferred funds within the simulation.

Challenges Faced
- Navigating the environment and executing the Wright bash commands to access the account.

Conclusion
This simulation helped me understand banking security measures and attack techniques.
